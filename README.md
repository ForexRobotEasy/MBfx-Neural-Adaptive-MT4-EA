# MBfx Neural Adaptive MT4 EA

This code is an implementation of the MBfx Neural Adaptive MT4 EA, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The EA utilizes AI models, price action strategies, and risk management techniques to perform automated trading operations in the foreign exchange (forex) market. 

## How It Works

The code is structured into several sections and functions to handle different aspects of the trading process.

### Global Variables and Libraries

The necessary libraries and declarations are included at the beginning of the code. These libraries provide the required functions and data structures for the EA to interact with the MT4 trading platform.

### Configuration Variables

Global variables are defined to hold the configuration settings for the EA. These variables can be modified to customize the behavior of the EA according to the user's preferences.

### Helper Functions

Helper functions are implemented to support various aspects of the trading process. These functions include AI models for market entry and timing, price action strategies, risk management features, and market analysis tools.

### OnTick Function

The `OnTick` function is responsible for handling real-time updates and analysis of market conditions. Inside this function, the `Trade` function is called to execute trading operations based on the current market conditions.

### OnInit Function

The `OnInit` function is executed during the initialization phase of the EA. It performs necessary setup and configurations, and returns the initialization result.

### OnDeinit Function

The `OnDeinit` function is responsible for cleaning up and terminating the EA. It releases any allocated resources and performs necessary cleanup operations.

### OnStart Function

The `OnStart` function is the main entry point of the EA. It runs the EA indefinitely in a loop, executing trading operations using the `Trade` function. The loop includes a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) between iterations to control the frequency of trades.

### Trade Function

The `Trade` function implements the core trading operations of the EA. It utilizes AI models for market entry and timing, price action strategies, risk management features, and executes trades using the MT4 trading platform. The function also provides real-time updates and analysis of market conditions, implements error handling and logging mechanisms, and optimizes the code for performance and resource usage.
